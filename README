Transferring Data from Amazon S3 to Rackspace CloudFiles
Background: 
    Amazon S3 and Rackspace CloudFiles are both Unlimited Storage services that charge per usage ( size of content you have there, the amount you transfer per month, ...)
In my opinion, they are not very different but I can note that:

    On Amazon, you can choose to have your data physically (and legally) stored in Europe
    With Rackspace CloudFiles, you don't get charged for CDN initial fetches (when your files are sent to the caching servers of LimeLight Networks for worldwide delivery)
    For CDN functionality, Amazon uses its own infrastructure while CloudFiles uses the already established LimeLight services
    Amazon has been in this file storage business relatively longer than Rackspace
    CloudFiles have a control Panel while Amazon has none (one has to use third party tools like S3Fox, ...)
    Rackspace has a fanatical support but S3 has nothing similar
    Amazon S3 supports some functionalities like setting up Access Control Lists

Why would one need to switch to CloudFiles from S3?
I don't have any specific reasons why you would do that, but simply giving a tool to help in that case
